# SuperPeachSisters
Remixed version of Super Mario Bros

This repository contains all the source code utilized in creating this project. 
All files are provided to us by the CS32 project spec, however the logic behind the game is written by me. 
Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, StudentWorld.cpp are the files which we were tasked to implement. These 4 files account for all the logic in the game such as sprite interactions, level changes, game restarting, ending, point system, in-game text, etc.
